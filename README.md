## 🙋🏻‍♀️ Hi there 

Hello, I'm Dominika. I’m a researcher with an experience in data analysis and Python programming. I’ve recently completed my PhD in Quantum Physics at Imperial College, during which I worked on an interdisciplinary project about single photon sources. I’m now motivated to transition to the data science industry,  bringing analytical skills, attention to detail and strong mathematical foundations to new challenges.
